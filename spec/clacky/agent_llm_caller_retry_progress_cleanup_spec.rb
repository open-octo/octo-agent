# Regression tests for the "retrying progress stays on screen forever" bug.
#
# Repro in the wild: a user sees
#
#     Network failed: Net::OpenTimeout (1/10) [1/10]… (681s) (Ctrl+C to interrupt)
#
# long after the task has completed. The seconds counter keeps ticking,
# even though the agent is idle.
#
# Root cause: LlmCaller's transient-failure paths call
#
#     @ui.show_progress(..., progress_type: "retrying", phase: "active", ...)
#
# which, through UIController's legacy shim, allocates a *separate*
# :quiet ProgressHandle under the "retrying" slot. Once the retry
# eventually succeeds, nothing calls
#
#     show_progress(progress_type: "retrying", phase: "done")
#
# so the handle is never finished. Its ticker thread keeps running, its
# OutputBuffer entry stays live, and the user sees the stale seconds
# counter. A grep across the repo confirms there is no such "done" call
# anywhere — the slot is pure-fire-and-forget.
#
# These specs pin down the contract: whenever LlmCaller has opened a
# "retrying" progress slot during a call_llm invocation, that slot MUST
# be closed before the call returns (success) or propagates
# (unrecoverable failure). The agent-level ensure block is also expected
# to clean up any stray "retrying" slot as a defense-in-depth safety
# net, in case a future code path forgets.
