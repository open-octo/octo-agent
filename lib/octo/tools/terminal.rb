    # Unified terminal tool — the SINGLE entry point for running shell
    # commands. Replaces the former `shell` + `safe_shell` tools.
    #
    # === AI-facing contract
    #
    # Five call shapes, all on one tool:
    #
    #   1) Run a command, wait for it:
    #        terminal(command: "ls -la")
    #        → { exit_code: 0, output: "..." }
    #
    #   2) Run a command that is expected to keep running (dev servers,
    #      watchers, REPLs meant to stay open):
    #        terminal(command: "rails s", background: true)
    #      – collects ~2s of startup output, then:
    #      – if it crashed in those 2s → { exit_code: N, output: "..." }
    #      – if still alive           → { session_id: 7, state: "background",
    #                                     output: "Puma starting..." }
    #
    #   3) A previous call returned a session_id because the command
    #      blocked on input (sudo password, REPL, etc.). Answer it:
    #        terminal(session_id: 3, input: "mypass\n")
    #
    #   4) Poll a running session for new output without sending anything:
    #        terminal(session_id: 7, input: "")
    #
    #   5) Kill a stuck / no-longer-wanted session:
    #        terminal(session_id: 7, kill: true)
    #
    # === Response handshake
    #
    #   - Response has `exit_code` → command finished.
    #   - Response has `session_id` → command is still running;
    #     look at `state`: "waiting" means blocked on input,
    #     "background" means intentionally long-running.
    #
    # === Safety
    #
    # Every new `command` is routed through Octo::Tools::Security before
    # being handed to the shell. This:
    #   - Blocks sudo / pkill octo / eval / curl|bash / etc.
    #   - Rewrites `curl ... | bash` into "download & review".
    #   - Protects Gemfile / .env / .ssh / etc. from writes.
    # `rm` is additionally intercepted at runtime by a shell function
    # installed in each PTY session (see SAFE_RM_BASH): it moves files
    # into the per-project trash at $OCTO_TRASH_DIR instead of
    # deleting them. See trash_manager for list/restore.
    # `input` is NOT subject to these rules (it is a reply to an already-
    # running program, not a fresh command).
    class Terminal < Base
      self.tool_name = "terminal"
      self.tool_description = <<~DESC.strip
        Run shell commands via PTY. Safety: rm→trash, sudo blocked, secrets protected.

        Two modes:
          {command}                  DEFAULT — sync. Quick commands return {exit_code, output} immediately. Slow build/test/install commands are auto-routed to async by the harness (you get a handle, see below). Hits idle on an interactive prompt → also returns a handle.
          {command, async:true}      Async — never blocks. Use for a long task you intend to leave running (build, deploy, side quest). Returns a handle.

        Five operations on an existing handle:
          {handle_id}                            Query status. Returns {state, command, elapsed_seconds, output_file, exit_code (if exited)}.
          {handle_id, input:"y\n"}               Send input to the PTY + poll for new output. Use to answer prompts, drive REPLs, etc.
          {handle_id, kill:true}                 Terminate the underlying process and free the handle.
          Read(output_file)                      Read the raw PTY log file directly — fastest way to peek at progress mid-flight. (output_file path is in every handle response.)
          (wait for notification)                A <task-notification> with the same handle_id is pushed to your context when the task exits — you don't need to poll.

        Response shape:
          - sync completes → {exit_code, output, state:"exited"}
          - sync hits idle (prompt waiting) → {handle_id, state:"waiting", output, output_file}
          - async accepted → {accepted:true, handle_id, state:"running", output_file, startup_output}
          - handle query/input → {handle_id, state, ...} plus exit_code if state=="exited"

        If output exceeds the limit, `output` is truncated and `full_output_file`
        points at a file on disk — use terminal(command: "grep ... <path>") to search it.
        input supports byte escapes: \x03 Ctrl-C, \x04 Ctrl-D, \t Tab, \x1b Esc.

        GUIDANCE:
          - Default to sync. The harness recognises build/test/install patterns and
            auto-switches them to async — you don't need to think about it.
          - Use async:true when you want to fire off a long task and continue with
            unrelated work (you'll get a notification on completion). Also use it
            for dev servers, watchers, REPLs you need to control later — same flag,
            same handle.
          - Never poll a handle in a tight loop — wait for the notification, or
            Read(output_file) once if you really need to peek.

      # Absolute path to the safe-rm shell snippet shipped with the gem.

      # function that moves files to $OCTO_TRASH_DIR instead of
      # deleting them.
      #
      # Why source-from-file instead of writing the function body into
      # the PTY directly?
      #   Writing a multi-line function definition into `zsh -l -i` is
      #   unreliable — ZLE (Zsh Line Editor) treats multi-line input as
      #   interactive editing and garbles the body. Loading from a file
      #   via a single `source` line avoids ZLE entirely.
      #
      # Why a shell function (instead of a Ruby-side text rewrite)?
      #   A function defers parsing to the shell itself, so heredocs,
      #   multi-line commands, globs, and variable expansion are all
      #   handled correctly. The previous Ruby rewriter mis-parsed any
      #   command containing a heredoc body with "rm" in it.
      #
      # Coverage:
      #   Intercepts  — direct `rm …` in the interactive shell (incl.
      #                 multi-line, heredoc, glob, env-var expansion).
      #   Bypassed by — `command rm`, `/bin/rm`, `xargs rm`, `find -exec rm`,
      #                 child scripts. Same coverage as the old rewriter.

      #      char drop ate the leading `{` or first chars of the command):
      #        ails runner foo.rb ... }; __octo_ec=$?; printf " __OCTO_DONE_<token>_%s__ " "$__octo_ec"

      #      echo). Same shape as (1) or (2) but not anchored to the start.
