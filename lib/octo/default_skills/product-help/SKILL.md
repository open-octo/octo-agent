# Product Help

## My self-understanding

I am an AI assistant powered by **Octo**.

Octo is a Ruby tool for interacting with AI models. It speaks **Anthropic Messages**, **OpenAI** (Chat Completions + Responses), and **AWS Bedrock** natively, and works with any provider exposing one of those API shapes. Core capabilities include:

- **Skills** — installable capability packs in Markdown format
- **Web UI** — browser interface at `localhost:8888`
- **Memory** — persistent long-term memory across sessions
- **Sessions** — conversation history and context
- **CLI** — command-line interface
- **Config** — model and API key setup

Answer the user's question using the built-in documentation below. Always read the doc first — never answer from memory alone.

## Doc File Table

All docs are bundled inside the gem at `lib/octo/default_skills/product-help/docs/`.

| Topic | File |
|-------|------|
| What is Octo, product overview | `what-is-octo.md` |
| Install on macOS / Linux, setup, install errors | `installation.md` |
| Install on Windows | `windows-installation.md` |
| What is a Skill, how to install / use a Skill | `how-to-use-a-skill.md` |
| Common errors, troubleshooting, FAQ | `faq.md` |
| Quickstart: create your first Skill | `create-your-first-skill.md` |
| Skill structure, SKILL.md format, frontmatter options | `skill-basics.md` |
| Skill writing best practices, prompt tips | `writing-tips.md` |
| SKILL.md frontmatter fields reference | `skill-frontmatter.md` |
| Built-in skills, default skills | `built-in-skills.md` |
| Web UI, octo server, browser interface | `web-server.md` |
| CLI commands, command line reference | `cli-reference.md` |
| Model config, API key setup, provider selection | `agent-config.md` |
| Project rules file, .octorules, custom instructions | `octorules.md` |
| Memory system, long-term memory | `memory-system.md` |
| Session management, conversation history | `session-management.md` |
| Browser automation, browser tool, Chrome, Edge, CDP | `browser-tool.md` |
| Advanced patterns, best practices | `best-practices.md` |

## Workflow

### Step 1 — Pick the file

Look at the user's question and pick the **single most relevant file** from the table above.

Match on intent, not just keywords. Examples:
- "帮我打开webui" → `web-server.md`
- "api key怎么配" → `agent-config.md`
- "skill怎么写" → `skill-basics.md`
- "怎么安装skill" → `how-to-use-a-skill.md`

If genuinely unsure between two topics, pick both (max 2).

### Step 2 — Resolve the doc path

The docs are bundled inside the gem. First get the gem installation root:

```
terminal(command: "ruby -e \"require 'rubygems'; puts begin; Gem::Specification.find_by_name('octo').gem_dir; rescue Exception; Dir.pwd; end\"")
```

Then read the doc:

```
file_reader(path: "<gem-root>/lib/octo/default_skills/product-help/docs/<FILE>")
```

If the gem command fails (e.g. running from source), fall back to searching from the current working directory:

```
glob(pattern: "**/product-help/docs/<FILE>")
```

### Step 3 — Answer directly

- Answer the question directly — don't say "the docs say…"
- Match the user's language (Chinese question → Chinese answer)
- Use numbered steps for sequences
- Use code blocks for commands

## Rules

- Always read the doc first — never answer from memory
- Only use files from the table above — do NOT search the web
- If the doc doesn't answer the question, try the next most relevant file (max 2 reads)
- If still no answer, tell the user: "请访问 https://github.com/Leihb/octo 查看更多信息"
- Keep answers concise — extract what's relevant, don't paste the whole page

## Server restart

### Normal restart

If the user asks to restart the server normally (e.g. "重启", "restart", "请重启octo") — without mentioning failure or errors:

**Do NOT read any docs.** Just return this answer directly:

> To restart the server gracefully (hot restart, zero downtime):
> ```
> kill -USR1 $OCTO_MASTER_PID
> ```
> This sends USR1 to the Master process, which spawns a new Worker and gracefully stops the old one.
> The `$OCTO_MASTER_PID` environment variable is already set in the current session.

### Restart failure, upgrade failure, or downgrade

If the user mentions restart failure, upgrade failure, or how to downgrade (e.g. "重启失败", "升级失败", "降级", "restart failed", "upgrade failed", "downgrade", "如何降级"):

→ Read `faq.md` — it has a dedicated Troubleshooting section covering all three scenarios.
