          ## Quick Analysis

          Reflect on whether the skill could be improved:
          - Were the instructions clear enough?
          - Did you encounter any edge cases not covered?
          - Were there any steps that could be streamlined?
          - Is there missing context that would make it easier next time?
          - Did the skill produce the expected results?

          ## Decision

          If you identified **concrete, actionable improvements**:
            → Call invoke_skill("skill-creator", task: "Improve skill #{skill_name}: [describe specific improvements needed]")

          If the skill worked well as-is:
            → Respond briefly: "Skill #{skill_name} worked well, no improvements needed."

          ## Constraints

          - DO NOT spend more than 30 seconds on this reflection
          - Be specific and actionable in your improvement suggestions
          - Only suggest improvements that would make a meaningful difference
          - If you're unsure, err on the side of "no improvements needed"
        PROMPT
