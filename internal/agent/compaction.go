Output exactly these five sections:

## Primary Request
The user's overall goal and any explicit, still-active instructions or constraints.

## Key Technical Concepts
Architecture, libraries, patterns, and decisions established so far.

## Files and Code
Files read or modified (with paths), and the important changes made to each.

## Errors and Fixes
Errors encountered and how they were resolved; anything still broken.

## Current State and Next Steps
What was just completed, and the immediate next action if the task is unfinished.`

// maybeCompact summarizes the older portion of history when the most recent

// "compaction disabled / not needed" or "compacted successfully"; an error
// means the summarization side-call failed (the caller logs and proceeds with
// uncompacted history rather than aborting the turn).
