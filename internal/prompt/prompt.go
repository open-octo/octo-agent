// the conventional way to let more specific instructions take precedence —
// project rules override the user's global rules, and --system overrides all.

// (see expandIncludes). env is passed in rather than computed here so this
// package stays pure (no os/exec, no git); the caller snapshots it once at
// session start, which keeps the cached prompt prefix stable across turns.
