// The interactive permission ask for IM channels: a tool call that resolves
// to an ask-class verdict sends a confirmation prompt into the chat, and the
// session's NEXT plain message is consumed as the answer. The inbound
// dispatcher routes that message via DeliverAskReply BEFORE spawning a turn —
// routing it through the normal turn path would deadlock behind runMu, which
// the asking turn still holds.

// BeginAsk claims the session's single ask slot and returns the channel on
// which the answer text will arrive, plus a release func the caller must run
// when the ask resolves (answer, timeout, or cancellation). chatID and userID
// pin who may answer: only a reply from the same chat by the same user is
// accepted — session keying usually guarantees this already (BindByChatUser),
// but the slot enforces it so the property survives other binding modes,
// where a session is shared across users or chats. A second BeginAsk while
// one is pending is refused — within a session turns are serialised, so this
// only guards against misuse.
