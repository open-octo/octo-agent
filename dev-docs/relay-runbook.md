# octo-relay runbook (M1a single node · M1b multi-node)

How to provision, operate, and verify a hosted octo-relay node. The relay is a
stateless dumb pipe (see `dev-docs/mobile-managed-tunnel-design.md`): it holds
no persistent data, terminates TLS, and bridges end-to-end-encrypted frames it
cannot read. Everything below is reproducible from scratch; losing the VM
loses nothing but uptime.

## Topology (M1a)

```
DNS: relay.octo.dev ──► 1 VM (octo-relay, systemd, TLS at the relay)
```

Multi-node SNI routing behind an L4 LB is M1b; this runbook covers the single
node it grows out of.

## Provision a node

1. **VM**: any small Linux VM (1 vCPU / 512 MB is plenty — the relay only
   copies frames). Open inbound 443 (and 80 if using certbot's HTTP-01).
2. **DNS**: point `relay.octo.dev` (A/AAAA) at the VM.
3. **User**:
   ```sh
   sudo useradd --system --no-create-home --shell /usr/sbin/nologin octo-relay
   ```
4. **Certificate** (single domain, Let's Encrypt HTTP-01):
   ```sh
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d relay.octo.dev
   ```
   Standalone HTTP-01 binds :80 only, and the relay binds :443 only, so
   issuance and renewals never conflict with a running relay. Give the
   service user read access:
   ```sh
   sudo groupadd -f octo-certs
   sudo usermod -aG octo-certs octo-relay
   sudo chgrp -R octo-certs /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
   sudo chmod -R g+rX /etc/letsencrypt/live /etc/letsencrypt/archive
   ```
5. **Renewal hook** — restart the relay when the cert renews:
   ```sh
   sudo tee /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/octo-relay <<'EOF'
   #!/bin/sh
   systemctl restart octo-relay
   EOF
   sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/octo-relay
   ```
6. **Config + unit** (files in `cmd/octo-relay/deploy/`):
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/octo-relay
   sudo cp deploy/env.example /etc/octo-relay/env   # then edit paths if needed
   sudo cp deploy/octo-relay.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now octo-relay
   ```
7. **Binary**: from a checkout, `cmd/octo-relay/deploy/deploy.sh <ssh-host>`
   cross-builds linux/amd64, ships it, restarts the service, and curls
   `/healthz`.

## Verify

- **Liveness + version**: `curl https://relay.octo.dev/healthz` → `ok <version>`.
- **End to end**: on any machine, `octo serve --tunnel` (the default relay is
  already `wss://relay.octo.dev`), pair a phone via the QR, send a message.
- **Self-heal**: `sudo systemctl kill octo-relay` — systemd restarts it within
  seconds (`Restart=always`); both tunnel ends reconnect on their own.

## Operate

- **Logs**: `journalctl -u octo-relay -f`. The relay logs connection lifecycle
  only — never payloads, tokens, or anything content-derived. Keep it that way.
- **Upgrade**: rerun `deploy.sh`. In-flight tunnels drop on restart and both
  ends reconnect; no drain needed at this stage.
- **State**: none. Pairing tokens and connections live only in process memory.
  A restart invalidates unredeemed pairing QRs (the host re-offers its tokens
  on reconnect automatically).

## Scaling out (M1b: multi-node SNI routing)

Clients dial `wss://<tunnelid>.relay.octo.dev` (the host's Go tunnel and both
native mobile plugins apply the same rule: DNS-named relay → tunnel-id
subdomain; IP/dotless hosts dial unchanged). An L4 balancer consistent-hashes
the TLS SNI, so both ends of a tunnel always land on the same node and nodes
never talk to each other.

```
DNS: relay.octo.dev + *.relay.octo.dev ─► HAProxy (SNI passthrough + consistent hash)
                                              │
                                     ┌────────┴────────┐
                                  relay VM1         relay VM2   (TLS terminates HERE)
```

1. **Wildcard cert** on every relay node: `*.relay.octo.dev` requires DNS-01
   (HTTP-01 can't issue wildcards):
   ```sh
   sudo certbot certonly --preferred-challenges dns \
     --dns-<provider> -d 'relay.octo.dev' -d '*.relay.octo.dev'
   ```
   Pick the certbot DNS plugin for wherever the zone is hosted; renewal is
   automatic via the same plugin. Update `/etc/octo-relay/env` to the new
   `live/relay.octo.dev*` paths if certbot picked a new lineage name.
2. **Balancer**: `cmd/octo-relay/deploy/haproxy.cfg` — TCP mode, TLS
   passthrough (`req.ssl_sni` from the ClientHello, never decrypted),
   `balance hash req.ssl_sni` + `hash-type consistent` (HAProxy ≥ 2.2). List
   every relay node as a `server` line.
3. **DNS**: move `relay.octo.dev` **and** `*.relay.octo.dev` to the balancer.
4. **Relay nodes**: nothing special — each node is the M1a setup with the
   wildcard cert. Nodes hold only in-memory state, so any assignment works
   as long as both ends of a tunnel agree (that's the SNI hash's job).
5. **Adding a node**: the consistent hash remaps ~1/N tunnels, but remapping
   only affects NEW connections — an established host WebSocket stays pinned
   to its old node while the (much more reconnect-happy) phone starts
   hashing to the new one, where neither the tunnel nor its pairing token
   exists. There is no keepalive to break the idle host connection, so the
   pair would stay split until the balancer's 4h client timeout. After
   adding a node, rolling-restart the EXISTING relay nodes
   (`systemctl restart octo-relay`, one at a time) so every host redials
   and lands per the new hash. Removing a node / node failure needs no such
   step — the break itself makes both ends redial.
6. **Compatibility**: multi-node requires BOTH ends of a tunnel to be ≥ M1b.
   A mixed pair (old phone + new host, or vice versa) hashes to different
   nodes — the token is registered on one node and redeemed on another,
   which 403s deterministically (the phone then drops its stored pairing
   and re-scanning doesn't help until the old end is upgraded). Only a pair
   where BOTH ends are query-only degrades gracefully: the balancer hashes
   `relay.octo.dev` for all of them onto one node, which merely concentrates
   load. On a single node everything interoperates (the relay reads
   `?tunnel=` first, then the Host's first DNS label).

Verify: pair a phone, then `systemctl stop octo-relay` on the node serving it
— both ends reconnect and meet on a surviving node within seconds.

## Local development

No flags = plaintext on :8090, same as the PoC. The relay is a nested Go
module, so run it from its own directory (the parent module doesn't contain
it):

```sh
(cd cmd/octo-relay && go run . --addr :8090)
octo serve --tunnel --relay ws://127.0.0.1:8090
```

Setting exactly one of `--tls-cert`/`--tls-key` is a startup error by design —
a typo'd path must not silently downgrade a production node to plaintext.
