# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code and other AI coding agents working in this repository. See `.octorules` for the human-facing project rules — this file expands them with the operational details an agent needs.

## Project

`octo-agent` — a Go 1.22+ AI agent CLI distributed as a single binary. Module path: `github.com/Leihb/octo-agent`. Roadmap and milestone plan: `dev-docs/go-rewrite-roadmap.md`.

## Commands

```bash
make build                                                  # ./octo (or set VERSION=0.x.y for releases)
make test                                                   # go test -race ./...
make vet                                                    # go vet ./...
make fmt-check                                              # gofmt -l . must print nothing
make fmt                                                    # gofmt -w .
make tidy                                                   # go mod tidy

go test ./internal/agent/                                   # single package
go test ./internal/provider/anthropic/ -run TestSendStream  # single test
go test -race -v ./internal/tools/                          # verbose race
```

`bundle`, `rspec`, `rubocop`, `rake` no longer apply — this is a Go-only project.

## Architecture

Four-layer stack with one-directional dependencies:

1. **CLI (`cmd/octo/`)** — entry point (`main.go`), flag parsing, REPL loop (`repl.go`), session resume/list flags, slash-command dispatch, output streaming. The only package allowed to import `provider` directly. Adapts a `provider.Provider` into an `agent.Sender` via `providerSender` so the agent package stays provider-agnostic.

2. **Agent core (`internal/agent/`)** — the loop, plus everything stateful:
   - `agent.go` — `Agent`, `Turn`, `TurnStream`, `Run`, `RunStream`. History rollback on error.
   - `history.go` — message log; goroutine-safe.
   - `content.go` — `ContentBlock` union (text / tool_use / tool_result). `Message.Blocks` overrides `Message.Content` when set; nil falls back to plain string for backward-compatible session JSON.
   - `session.go` — JSON persistence under `~/.octo/sessions/`.
   - `tool.go` — `ToolDefinition`, `ToolExecutor` interfaces.
   - `Sender` interface stack: `Sender` → `StreamingSender` → `ToolSender` → `ToolStreamingSender`. Each builds on the previous; type-assertion in callers picks the highest available capability.

3. **Providers (`internal/provider/`)** — per-vendor wire-format adapters. `provider.go` defines the interfaces; each subdirectory implements one protocol:
   - `anthropic/` — Messages API. `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version` headers. `system` as top-level field. Content blocks `[{type:"text", text}]`. SSE aggregator dispatches on `message_start`/`content_block_delta`/`message_delta`. Tool calls land as `content_block_start` of type `tool_use` with subsequent `input_json_delta` deltas.
   - `openai/` — Chat Completions. `Authorization: Bearer`. `system` carried as `messages[0]`. SSE aggregator parses `chat.completion.chunk`; tolerates missing `[DONE]` sentinel (some third-party servers omit it). Tool calls arrive in `delta.tool_calls[]` with chunked JSON arguments.

   Provider wire quirks are encapsulated here — the agent layer never branches on protocol.

4. **Tools (`internal/tools/`)** — concrete `ToolExecutor` implementations.
   - `terminal.go` — current canonical example. Tool name `terminal` rather than `bash` because the implementation shells out via the platform shell — `sh -c` on macOS/Linux, PowerShell (`pwsh`, else `powershell`) on Windows — not a hard `/bin/bash` dependency. The shell is selected in one place: `shellCommand` in `sandbox.go`. The model is told which shell it's on via the environment context (`cmd/octo/envcontext.go`).
   - `DefaultRegistry` dispatches by tool name. `DefaultTools()` returns the set sent to the LLM when `--tools` is on.

## Conventions

From `.octorules`:

- **One-directional deps.** `provider → agent` is enforced; `agent` must not import `provider`. Tests verify this implicitly by living in the same package as the code they test.
- **Test placement.** `*_test.go` siblings of source files. No external test frameworks beyond the stdlib + `httptest`.
- **No live network in `go test`.** All HTTP tests use `httptest.NewServer`. Integration tests against real APIs are run by hand with a real key, not in CI.
- **Comments in English.** Prefer self-documenting names; only comment the **why**, not the **what**.
- **gofmt is the formatter.** `gofmt -l .` must be empty before push.
- **Branch off latest main.** Never commit directly on `main`. Squash-and-merge is the default.

## Common pitfalls (from prior incidents)

- **Sending `Accept-Encoding: gzip` to Bing's HTML search endpoint** returns a ~39 KB JavaScript skeleton instead of the ~120 KB real results page. The M6 `web_search` tool must omit this header. See `dev-docs/go-rewrite-roadmap.md` M6 section for the full list of HTML-scraping gotchas.
- **OpenAI streaming + `stream_options.include_usage`.** Third-party OpenAI-compatible servers diverge on support; we don't send it. The trade-off is that streamed OpenAI turns report zero token counts in `Reply.InputTokens` / `OutputTokens` — buffered (`Send`) responses carry full usage.
- **OpenAI tool calls in streaming.** Function arguments arrive as JSON **fragments** across multiple chunks. The aggregator must concatenate by `tool_calls[i].index` before parsing.
- **`finish_reason: "tool_calls"` (OpenAI) vs `stop_reason: "tool_use"` (Anthropic).** The OpenAI adapter normalises `tool_calls` → `tool_use` on the agent-facing surface; the agent loop only ever sees `"tool_use"`.

## When in doubt

- Verify external claims (API endpoints, third-party SDK existence, dates) before committing them. `dev-docs/go-rewrite-roadmap.md` is a deliberate example: every claim about the WeChat iLink protocol was checked against the npm registry and live API hosts before landing.
- If `go test ./...` fails because of an environment issue (missing key, blocked network), say so explicitly rather than commenting out the test.
